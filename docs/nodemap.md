# [Draft] Nodemap 
In the resulting directory besides record logfiles a nodemap could present.
This file describes mapping between node id and actual server name.
It's assumed that this file is auto-generated by your logging library

File Example:
```json
{
  "nodemap": {
    "192.168.3.152:8998" : 7270346,
    "192.168.3.161:8080" : 84989
  }
}
```

The file always has a json object nodemap, which has pairs node name -> node id
